## Advantages of using a Social Media login

- Users can register faster - The process of registering is much easier compared to filling out a registration form, therefore they can sign up much quicker.

- Less logins for the user to remember - Users wont have to remember their username and password for the site, therefore its much easier for them to login again the next time they visit.

- Social logins are familiar - When a user visits a site they haven't used before, seeing familair logos such as Facebook, Google or Twitter make it more comfortable for them to login and start using the site.

## Advantages of using Angular and WebAPI

- SPA - using angular for the frontend of an application allows the UI to be fast, responsive and feature rich. Angular allows creating a great user experience no matter how complicated the application.

- WebAPI - ASP .net core api allows a CRUD api to easily and quickly be created that is then consumes by the angular front end application. This allows more time and development effort to be put into the frontend to create a great user experience.
