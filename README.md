## Advantages of using a Social Media login

- Users can register faster - The process of registering is much easier compared to filling out a registration form, therefore they can sign up much quicker.

- Less logins for the user to remember - Users wont have to remember their username and password for the site, therefore its much easier for them to login again the next time they visit.

- Social logins are familiar - When a user visits a site they haven't used before, seeing familair logos such as Facebook, Google or Twitter make it more comfortable for them to login and start using the site.
